  How we work together as a lab
---

We have a shared set of policies, tools, and approaches that as a group we've developed over the years to support a supportive and inclusive work environment and efficient collaboration.
These policies and procedures change and (hopefully) improve over time and all members of the lab are encouraged to propose changes to make the lab a better place to work.
We are in the process of developing a formal approach to proposing changes.
Until that is ready, start by touching base with Ethan or Morgan if you see a change that will make things better.
