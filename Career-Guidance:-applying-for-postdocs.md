Advice when applying to and interviewing for post doc positions

### Funding
Allison Barner has very helpfully put together a google spreadsheet of postdoc fellowships (get your own money=freedom to do what you want):

Beckman Postdoctoral Fellows (http://www.beckman-foundation.org/programs/beckman-postdoctoral-fellows): The Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellows Award Program supports postdoctoral scholars with the highest potential for success in an independent academic career in chemistry and the life sciences, to assist in their transition from “mentored yet independent” postdoctoral projects to an independent, tenure-track position. These individuals are expected to become the next generation of leaders and innovators in science, engineering, and technology.

"Understanding Dynamic and Multi-scale Systems" at the McDonnell Foundation that might be a good fit for several folks in the group https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/index.htm 

### Finding a position

There are also many sites where people who may already have money for a postdoc post ads (get paid from someone else's grant = less freedom to do what you want):

ECOLOG listserv https://listserv.umd.edu/archives/ecolog-l.html

Texas A&M job board http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/

Society for Conservation Biology http://careers.conbio.org/jobs/

### General advice

### Good questions to ask

Working environment questions for other lab members:

"How has [adviser] changed since you first began working with them?"

"Is there anything you've been hoping [adviser] would have changed by now, but hasn't?"
