## Committee

An SNRE committee needs to have at least 3 people. All 3 of those people need to be "SNRE affiliated", which means they must be on their list of faculty that are officially SNRE faculty. You can have faculty on your committee if they are not SNRE affiliated, but they won't count toward the minimum requirement.   
Any faculty in the University can become SNRE affiliated by sending a letter to Karen. They must be approved, which can take a few months. So make sure they are thru this before you take your quals.  
The SNRE forms say that 50% of your committee cannot be from the same department, but this is not enforced. 

## Qualifying Exames

Quals can take whatever format you and your committee decides. There is no formal guide on this, but a handbook of tips was put out.  [SNRE Quals](https://github.com/weecology/lab-wiki/raw/master/uploads/SNRE_quals_tips.pdf)
